# SBOM Report — build (2025-12-12)

**Total Dependencies:** 140

## Executive Summary
This repository demonstrates excellent license compliance with 100% permissive licensing (MIT, ISC, Apache-2.0, BSD). The dependency stack is typical of a Node.js/Express web application with Socket.io real-time capabilities and SQLite database. Key security considerations include outdated package versions and native binary dependencies requiring ongoing monitoring.

## Dependency Overview

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Total Packages | 140 | |
| NPM Packages | 134 | Web application and utility libraries |
| GitHub Actions | 6 | CI/CD workflow automation |
| With MIT License | 117 | 84% of total - most permissive |
| With ISC License | 10 | 7% - MIT-equivalent |
| Other Permissive | 13 | 9% - Apache-2.0, BSD variants |

## License Compliance

| Risk Level | Licenses | Count | Commercial Impact |
|------------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Low Risk | MIT, ISC | 127 | ✅ Safe for commercial use, no attribution requirements in binary |
| Low Risk | Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, BSD-2-Clause | 5 | ✅ Safe for commercial use, BSD requires attribution |
| Low Risk | (MIT OR WTFPL) | 1 | ✅ Dual-licensed, can use under MIT terms |
| Medium Risk | - | 0 | None present |
| High Risk | GPL, AGPL, LGPL | 0 | ✅ None present - no copyleft concerns |
| Unknown | GitHub Actions | 6 | Generally safe for CI/CD use, covered by GitHub ToS |

**License Compliance Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT - 100% permissive licensing suitable for commercial and proprietary use.

## Security Observations

• **Outdated Dependencies:** `debug@2.6.9` is severely outdated (current: 4.x). Legacy version suggests transitive dependency requiring update.

• **Native Module Risk:** `better-sqlite3@12.2.0` includes native binaries, requiring platform-specific builds and careful security review for memory safety.

• **Known Vulnerability History:** `minimist@1.2.8` and `qs@6.11.0` have had past prototype pollution vulnerabilities. Current versions should be verified against CVE databases.

• **Express Framework:** Running `express@4.18.2` (released late 2022). Should update to latest 4.x patch for security fixes.

• **GitHub Actions Pinning:** Actions use major version tags (v4, v5, v6) rather than commit SHAs, accepting automatic updates within major versions - standard practice but less secure than SHA pinning.

## Recommendations

### 1. Run Security Audit
**Why:** Multiple packages have known vulnerability histories requiring verification.
**Action:** Execute `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` in all package.json directories (root, client, server) and review findings. Update packages with HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities immediately.

### 2. Update Outdated Dependencies
**Why:** `debug@2.6.9` is 5+ years old and may indicate stale dependency chains.
**Action:** Run `npm outdated` to identify update candidates. Prioritize security-sensitive packages (body-parser, express, cookie-parser). Test thoroughly after updates.

### 3. Establish Dependency Monitoring
**Why:** Continuous monitoring prevents security debt accumulation.
**Action:** Enable Dependabot or Renovate bot for automated PR creation on security updates. Configure GitHub security alerts for vulnerability notifications.

### 4. Consider Action SHA Pinning (Optional)
**Why:** Major version tags in GitHub Actions can auto-update to potentially compromised versions.
**Action:** For production workflows, consider pinning to specific commit SHAs for critical actions (checkout, setup-node) with Dependabot monitoring for updates.
